# Exploring the Relationships Between Economic Growth and Population Change

This is a data analysis project aimed at exploring how economic growth in a region affects its population. It covers a date range of twenty years between 2000 and 2020.

The goal was to explore whether regions of the United States with growing economies are more likely to attract newcomers than other parts of the country. The project also attempts to model the data in order to make population predictions for the period between 2020 and 2025. I hope you find it as interesting as I did!
